# QM/QFT as a Limiting Case in General Substrate Theory

## Overview

This paper presents a structural reinterpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) through the lens of **General Substrate Theory (GST)**, also known as **Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)**. It introduces a coherent, Lorentz-invariant substrate that supports quantum behavior over finite intervals, providing a physical basis for wavefunction evolution, collapse, and entanglement.

Standard QM/QFT is preserved in full mathematical form, but shown to be causally bounded within discrete coherence intervals called **Causality Intervals (CI)**. These intervals terminate at a **Collapse Boundary (CB)**, after which the structure either re-locks or emits via a **Quantum Emission Opportunity (QEO)**.

## Key Contributions

- **Collapse as Re-lock**: Collapse is not observer-triggered but a structural resolution enforced by the substrate at the end of each CI.
- **Measurement Reinterpreted**: Measurement becomes the first moment at which the committed structure becomes externally accessible—not a cause, but an effect.
- **Frame-Dependent Time Symmetry**: Time evolution within the CI proceeds forward (\(+t\)), while post-collapse observers reconstruct history retrospectively (\(-t\)).
- **Entanglement as Resonant Tuning**: Correlation arises from shared coherence geometry, not nonlocal linkage.
- **Causal Filtering**: Only phase-compatible, causally connected structures respond to collapse emissions—resolving paradoxes around nonlocality and decoherence.

## Figures and Diagrams

- **Train Analogy**: Illustrates the difference between QM/QFT’s static frame and QSD’s coherence-tracking frame.
- **CI/CB/QEO Causal Cycle**: Visualizes the evolution and collapse of quantum structure within a coherence interval.
- **Perspective Diagram**: Shows how internal and external observers interpret time differently across collapse boundaries.
