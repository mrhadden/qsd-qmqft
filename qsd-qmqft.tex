{Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (QM/QFT) accurately describe the statistical behavior and field dynamics of microscopic systems, yet remain conceptually incomplete when addressing collapse, measurement, and causality. This work proposes that QM/QFT are valid limiting cases within a broader causal framework---\textit{General Substrate Theory (QSD)}---in which quantum coherence, superposition, and field propagation are constrained by a physically real, Lorentz-compatible substrate.
We introduce the concept of the \textit{coherence tick}, a finite causal interval during which the substrate maintains structured waveforms as real, phase-resolved possibilities. Within this tick, standard QM/QFT formalisms---including unitary evolution, superposition, and entanglement---are fully supported. \textit{Collapse is not postulated}, but instead \textit{physically derived as the re-lock event} at the end of the tick: a structural commitment by the substrate that resolves all permissible phase configurations into one irreversible outcome. Measurement is thus reinterpreted not as an observer-triggered event, but as \textit{the first moment post-tick when the committed structure becomes externally accessible}.
This framework preserves all predictive successes of QM/QFT while resolving longstanding interpretive challenges, including the role of the observer, the timing of collapse, and the nature of quantum correlation. The model reinterprets entanglement as \textit{resonant coherence tuning} within a shared substrate mode, constrained by causal propagation (scalar pacing) and phase geometry.
By grounding quantum phenomena in substrate-limited coherence intervals, we unify the statistical reliability of quantum predictions with a deterministic, physically causal substrate mechanism. Collapse and causality are shown to emerge naturally, not through postulates, but through the enforced timing and structural resolution at the core of the substrate itself.}

\qsdmethodstatement
In support of the editorial process, generative AI tools—specifically OpenAI's \qsdgptname (version \qsdgptver, \qsdgptyear)—were used to assist in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating illustrative figures based on the author’s conceptual framework, with iterative refinement to ensure fidelity to the substrate-based dynamics of the model,
    \item Researching, validating, and cross-referencing related scientific concepts to improve accuracy, contextual alignment, and clarity,
    \item Summarizing and formatting externally sourced material already selected by the author.
\end{itemize}

No original theoretical contributions were generated by the AI system; all scientific claims, hypotheses, derivations, and interpretations were authored and reviewed by the human researcher. The use of ChatGPT is disclosed in alignment with journal policy for transparency in the writing process.
